## Why Imprompto?
Humans are inherently indecisive. Put a group of humans together and suddenly agreeing on a decision becomes impossible. Queue Imprompto! The app to silence your hesitation, because it makes the decision for you. Gone are the days of restaurant suggestion round robin! 

Your group can rest easy, because determining your next adventure is as easy as opening the app and hitting go!

## How does it work?
Once the user has entered a few details, such as category and radius distance, ImprompTo utilizes the Foursquare API to find the top places matching your search. Once it has acquired the top venues, it randomly picks one and delivers it back to the user. The user is able to see the name, location, and details of the venue, as well as call upon the integrated Google Maps API for directions.
